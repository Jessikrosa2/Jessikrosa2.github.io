            Alice meets the White Rabbit again, who mistakes her for a servant  
            sends her off to fetch his things. While in the White Rabbit's house 
            Alice drinks an unmarked bottle of liquid and grows to the size of  
            room. The White Rabbit returns to his house, fuming at the now-giant 
            Alice, but she swats him and his servants away with her giant hand. 
            The animals outside try to get her out of the house by throwing rock 
            at her, which inexplicably transform into cakes when they land in  
            house. Alice eats one of the cakes, which causes her to shrink to a 
            small size. She wanders off into the forest, where she meets a 
            Caterpillar sitting on a mushroom and smoking a hookah 
            a water pipe. The Caterpillar and Alice get into an argument, 
            but before the Caterpillar crawls away in disgust, he tells Alice 
            that different parts of the mushroom will make her grow or shrink. 
            Alice tastes a part of the mushroom, and her neck stretches above  
            trees. A pigeon sees her and attacks, deeming her a serpent hungry 
            for pigeon eggs.
