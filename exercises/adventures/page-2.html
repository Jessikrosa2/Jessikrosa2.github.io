        <h1>Ten Feet Tall</h1>

        <p>
            Alice eats another part of the mushroom and shrinks down to a normal 
            height. She wanders until she comes across the house of the Duchess. 
            She enters and finds the Duchess, who is nursing a squealing baby. 
            well as a grinning Cheshire Cat, and a Cook who tosses massive amo 
            of pepper into a cauldron of soup. The Duchess behaves rudely to  
            and then departs to prepare for a croquet game with the Queen. As  
            leaves, the Duchess hands Alice the baby, which Alice discovers is  
            Alice lets the pig go and reenters the forest, where she meets the 
            Cheshire Cat again. The Cheshire Cat explains to Alice that everyone 
            in Wonderland is mad, including Alice herself. The Cheshire Cat give 
            directions to the March Hare's house and fades away to nothing but a 
            floating grin.
