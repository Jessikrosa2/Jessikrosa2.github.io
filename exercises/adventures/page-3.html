            Alice meets the White Rabbit again, who mistakes her for a servant 
            and sends her off to fetch his things. While in the White Rabbit's 
            house, Alice drinks an unmarked bottle of liquid and grows to the 
            size of the room. The White Rabbit returns to his house, fuming at 
            the now-giant Alice, but she swats him and his servants away with 
            her giant hand. The animals outside try to get her out of the house 
            by throwing rocks at her, which inexplicably transform into cakes 
            when they land in the house. Alice eats one of the cakes, which 
            causes her to shrink to a small size. She wanders off into the 
            forest, where she meets a Caterpillar sitting on a mushroom and 
            smoking a hookah (i.e., a water pipe). The Caterpillar and Alice 
            get into an argument, but before the Caterpillar crawls away in 
            disgust, he tells Alice that different parts of the mushroom will 
            make her grow or shrink. Alice tastes a part of the mushroom, 
            and her neck stretches above the trees. A pigeon sees her and 
            attacks, deeming her a serpent hungry for pigeon eggs.
