        <h1>Ending 2- Ten Feet Tall</h1>

        <p>
            Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a 
            moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was 
            another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, 
            hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went 
            Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it 
            turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!” 
            She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit 
            was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, 
            which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
