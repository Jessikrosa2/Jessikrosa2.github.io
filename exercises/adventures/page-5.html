        <h1>Ending 3- A Mad Tea Party</h1>

        <p>
            Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of 
            solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, 
            and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the 
            doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, 
            or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of 
            them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low 
            curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door 
            about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the 
            lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
