            After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on 
            going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she 
            got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, 
            and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not 
            possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, 
            and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but 
            it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, 
            the poor little thing sat down and cried. 
            “Come, there's no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, 
            rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She 
            generally gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom 
            followed it, and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to 
            bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box 
            her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she 
            was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond 
            of pretending to be two people. “But it's no use now,” thought poor 
            Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of 
            me left to make one respectable person!”
