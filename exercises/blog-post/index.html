                The Flintstones, American animated television sitcom that 
                aired on ABC from September 30, 1960, to September 2, 1966. 
                The show is notable for being the first original 
                animated series to air in prime time and for its appeal 
                to adults as well as children. The original series aired 
                a total of 166 episodes and led to a theatrical Flintstones 
                motion picture, a spy satire titled The Man Called Flintstone 
                (1966), following the sixth and final season, as well as 
                numerous new series and spin-offs.

                The Flintstones was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, 
                an animation studio founded by Academy Award-winning producers 
                William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The studio was known for its 
                use of limited animation, a cost-cutting process that required 
                fewer animation cels to portray motion.
                John H. Mitchell, an executive with Screen Gems, 
                which distributed cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera 
                Productions, is credited with suggesting the 
                development of a prime-time animated series. 
                Family-based sitcoms dominated television at the time, so 
                several comedic scenarios were proposed and rejected, 
                including setting the series in ancient Rome. Other ideas 
                included featuring characters such as pilgrims or hillbillies.

                The Flintstones is set in the town of Bedrock and features
                bombastic patriarch Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed); 
                his wife, Wilma (Jean Vander Pyl); and their neighbors and 
                best friends, Barney (Mel Blanc) and Betty Rubble initially 
                voiced by Bea Benaderet and later by Gerry Johnson. 
                The relationships and behavior of the show's four main 
                characters would prove to be much reminiscent of that of 
                the principals in the classic TV sitcom The Honeymooners 
                1955/56 starring Jackie Gleason, Audrey Meadows, Art Carney, 
                and Joyce Randolph. Fred works as a dino-crane operator in a 
                quarry and, along with Barney, is a member of the Loyal 
                Order of Water Buffaloes lodge. A running gag throughout 
                the series is Fred's efforts to get rich quick, which 
                usually backfire.
