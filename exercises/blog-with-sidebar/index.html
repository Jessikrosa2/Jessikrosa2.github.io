                    The Flintstones, American animated television sitcom that 
                    aired on ABC from September 30, 1960, to September 2, 1966. 
                    The show is notable for being the first original 
                    animated series to air in prime time and for its appeal 
                    to adults as well as children. The original series aired 
                    a total of 166 episodes and led to a theatrical Flintstones 
                    motion picture, a spy satire titled The Man Called Flintston 
                    (1966), following the sixth and final season, as well as 
                    numerous new series and spin-offs.

                    The Flintstones was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, 
                    an animation studio founded by Academy Award-winning  
                    producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The studio  
                    was known for its use of limited animation,  
                    a cost-cutting process that required fewer animation 
                    cels to portray motion.  John H. Mitchell, an executive    
                    with Screen Gems, which distributed cartoons produced
                    by Hanna-Barbera  Productions, is credited with suggesting 
                    the development of a prime-time animated series. 
                    Family-based sitcoms dominated television at the time, so 
                    several comedic scenarios were proposed and rejected, 
                    including setting the series in ancient Rome. Other ideas 
                    included featuring characters such as pilgrims.

                    The Flintstones is set in the town of Bedrock and features
                    bombastic patriarch Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed); 
                    his wife, Wilma (Jean Vander Pyl); and their neighbors and 
                    best friends, Barney (Mel Blanc) and Betty Rubble initially 
                    voiced by Bea Benaderet and later by Gerry Johnson. 
                    The relationships and behavior of the show's four main 
                    characters would prove to be much reminiscent of that of 
                    the principals in the classic TV sitcom The Honeymooners 
                    1955/56 starring Jackie Gleason, Audrey Meadows, Art Carney, 
                    and Joyce Randolph. Fred works as a dino-crane operator in a 
                    quarry and, along with Barney, is a member of the Loyal 
                    Order of Water Buffaloes lodge. A running gag throughout 
                    the series is Fred's efforts to get rich quick, which 
                    usually backfire.
