        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Steak</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound thinly shaved steak</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
            <li>1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Veggies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 large yellow onion, sliced or chopped</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cook the Veggies:</b> In a pan over medium heat, add oil 
                and saut√© the diced onion and sliced bell pepper. Season with 
                salt and black pepper. Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes, until the 
                onions are soft and translucent and the peppers are tender. 
                Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes, 
                then remove from the pan and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cook the Steak:</b> In the same pan, heat the butter and oil  
                medium-high heat. Add the shaved steak and let it sear 
                minutes to get some browning. Then season with salt, paprika,  
                and black pepper. Stir in Worcestershire sauce and beef broth,  
                another 3 to 5 minutes, until the liquid reduces and the steak 
                tender. Turn off the heat and stir the veggies back in.
            </li>
            <li><b>Assemble the Tacos:</b> On each tortilla, sprinkle some  
                scoop of the steak and veggie mixture, and top with a little  
                Fold over the tortilla to close.
            </li>
            <li><b>Toast the Tacos:</b> Heat a pan or griddle over medium heat 
                of oil. Toast each taco for about 2 to 3 minutes per side
            </li> 
            <li>Enjoy warm and bonus points with ketchup!</li>

        <h1>Motcha Milk Jam</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Prep Time:</b> 5 mins.
            <b>Cook Time:</b> 1 hour.
            <b>Total Time:</b> 1 hour.
            <b>Yields:</b> 1 1/2 cup.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon matcha powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons room temp water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, cream, 
                sugar, cornstarch, milk powder, and vanilla extract until 
                smooth and fully dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the pan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often, 
                until it begins to gently bubble.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue cooking on low to medium-low heat for 45 minutes 
                to 1 hour, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. 
                The mixture should reduce and thicken to a creamy, jammy 
                consistency that coats the back of a spoon. 
            </li>
            <li>
                While it's cooking, whisk the matcha powder with the water 
                in a small bowl using a W and M motion until completely 
                smooth and lump-free.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the milk jam has thickened, 
                remove the pan from heat. Add the matcha mixture and whisk 
                until fully combined and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the matcha milk jam into a clean jar and let it cool 
                to room temperature. It will thicken slightly as it cools.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store in the refrigerator for up to one week. It continues 
                to firm up the longer it sits in the fridge, so give it a 
                stir before using if needed.

        <h1>Strawberry Lemonade</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Prep Time:</b> 30 mins
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            Simple Syrop
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cup granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup hot water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Strawberry Juice
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces strawberries</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Lemon Juice
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup lemon juice about 8 large lemons</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            TO MAKE THE SIMPLE SYRUP
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a microwave-safe bowl, add hot water along with 
                the sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Microwave for 30 seconds. Take it out and mix. Microwave 
                for another 30 seconds. Take it out and mix again. 
                If it is clear and all the sugar is dissolved, it's 
                done. If you still see sugar, microwave for another 30 
                seconds. Once clear, pop in the fridge to cool down to 
                room temperature.
            </li>
            <p>
                TO MAKE THE STRAWBERRY JUICE
            </p>
            <li>
                To a food processor, add the strawberries and water. 
                Blend until there is no more chunks and completely 
                smooth like a juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a fine sieve over a bowl and strain the juice to 
                remove the seeds. If it is pouring very slowly, just 
                swirl it around with a spoon and press gently against 
                the sieve and it will filter out a lot faster.
            </li>
            <p>
                TO MAKE THE LEMONADE
            </p>
            <li>
                To a very large pitcher, add the lemon juice and water 
                along with all the strawberry juice and 1 cup of the 
                simple syrup. Taste it. If you want it more sweet, add 
                the rest of the simple syrup. If you want a less strong 
                taste, dilute it with a little bit of water. I did not 
                add any extra water and used all the syrup and the 
                taste was perfect for me.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place in the fridge to chill or serve in a glass with 
                ice immediately and enjoy!
